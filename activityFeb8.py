# Using the tools we've learned in class 
# up to this point create blocks of code that will return a value.
#(you can use variables, data types, operators, etc.)

# 1. Create a block of code that uses the any of the arithmatic 
# operator and then print out the result.

number_A = int(input('enter a number'))
number_B = 20
print(number_A + number_B)

# 2. Create a block of code that uses the AND operator and and then
# print out the result.

ismember = True
goldtier= True

print(ismember and goldtier)

# 3. Create a block of code that uses the NOT EQUAL operator and then 
# use then print out the result

fruit_A = 'apples'
fruit_B =  'oranges

print(fruit_A != fruit_B)
